# Library Pulse - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Library Pulse is a comprehensive analytics platform for library directors, providing historical data analysis, comparative metrics, and AI-powered insights. The application helps library administrators make data-driven decisions by visualizing trends, comparing performance with similar libraries, and identifying opportunities for improvement.
