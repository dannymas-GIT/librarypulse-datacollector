# LibraryLens Migration: Status and Completion Steps

## What Has Been Accomplished

1. ✅ Created migration plan and documentation:
   - `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - `LIBRARYLENS_STANDARDIZATION.md`
   - `CI_CD_UPDATES.md`

2. ✅ Created and executed migration script:
   - `migrate_to_librarylens.sh` - Successfully migrated the local development database

3. ✅ Updated production deployment files:
   - `update-vps.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

4. ✅ Updated CI/CD configuration files:
   - `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
   - `docker-compose.nomount.yml`

5. ✅ Created a dedicated Git branch:
   - `standardize-to-librarylens`

## What Needs to Be Completed

1. Commit all changes to the Git branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete standardization to librarylens naming"
   ```

2. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin standardize-to-librarylens
   ```

3. Create a pull request on GitHub to merge these changes to main.

4. Review the pull request carefully, ensuring all "librarypulse" references have been updated.

5. Test the CI/CD pipeline on the branch to ensure builds pass with the new naming.

6. After merging to main, monitor the production deployment to ensure it works correctly.

7. Verify production services are running correctly:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/library-lens-lightsail ubuntu@library-lens.com
   cd /opt/projects/librarylens
   docker-compose ps
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider updating directory names for consistency:
   - Currently, the development environment is in `/opt/projects/librarypulse/datacollector`
   - Production is in `/opt/projects/librarylens`
   - A future PR could move development to `/opt/projects/librarylens-dev` for consistency

2. In the long term, consider renaming the GitHub repository from "librarypulse" to "librarylens" for complete consistency (requires additional planning).

3. Update any external documentation or references to reflect the standardized naming.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise after deployment:

1. Check the Docker logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   ```

2. Verify database connectivity:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d librarylens -c "SELECT 1 as test"
   ```

3. If necessary, restore from the backup:
   ```bash
   cat librarypulse_backup.sql | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres librarylens
   ```
